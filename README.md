# Hello-World
First deployment of a Java program to GlassFish

Followed the instructions of the GitHub guide, and this is how far I
have got. Good, I understand what this service is all about and I
think I need to encrypt my code, before uploading to the platform. 

Now let me get some examples first, before I start coding
myself... ;-)

So, now that I have uploaded the first file and received a new mask on
the platform with an additional feature called "Compare & Pull
request", I am thinking about if I really need to do this now...

Well, I am here to study the process, before I create my own
workflow...

Merged the changed files to master, added a few comments while doing
the workflow, I like this feature! Just missing a PRINT function for
my personal use on the desktop, ...and there is permanently a message
about uploading files in the text boxes, but I cannot see any UPLOAD
button nor the sense in these steps of the workflow???

Anyway I will upload now this file here and finalize the process
(2nd-step), that's it I am done.
