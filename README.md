#1st-deployment

#Short description
On a very simple way of starting coding a website, I want to find out, how the collaboration(s) between Cloudflare and github correspond to my local development environment.

#README

Some time ago I have purchased the domain https://SP109.me

I have started with analyzing on what does the internet offer to somebody starting from scratch. Security is the number one requirement these days. Therefore routing comes straight next. Who is in need of what information to provide and/or to know? Based on my requirements I had to create the following rules:

(A.) Presentation by Geo-Location (USA, Suisse, Germany)
(B.) Tor
(C.) Sponsoring/Membership

Results into the purpose and goal of my website. Next in line comes with the choice of selecting the right tools. Well, running on a low, very low budget limits the selections quite easy.

1.) Operating System: Linux
2.) Communication Provider: AldiSUISSE/Alditalk
3.) https://No-IP.com
4.) https://STORJ.io
5.) https://ngrok.io
6.) https://Cloudflare.com
7.) https://www.github.com
8.) DANGEROUSE ZONE

So far, so good. Coding time...
